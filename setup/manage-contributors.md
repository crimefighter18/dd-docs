# Manage Contributors

It is common to observe contributors using different accounts, email addresses, or usernames across different integrations. DevDynamics automatically merge accounts if email addresses are the same. However, for many integrations DevDynamics don't get access to the contributor email hence automatic merge is not possible.&#x20;

Team leads or managers can merge different accounts of the same contributor using DevDynamics Merge capability.

#### Step 1

Go to the merge contributor setting [page](https://app.devdynamics.ai/settings/contributors) (settings -> Contributors)



#### Step 2&#x20;

Search for the contributor. You will be presented with a list of all the accounts that match the search text.
