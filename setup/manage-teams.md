# Manage Teams

DevDynamics teams serve as a means to manage sub-org access and filter metric data across the product based on team assignments.&#x20;

A team acts as the container of a set of members, managers, Issue management projects, and Git repositories. When a team filter is applied to any metrics, DevDynamics filters the data as per members of the team, and in some case like deployment filtering happen by git repositories

In team settings, you have the option to specify a team email, Slack channel, or Microsoft Team channel to receive a daily digest. To create a new team, follow the steps outlined below.
