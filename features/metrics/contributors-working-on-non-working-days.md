# Contributors Working on Non-Working Days

### **1. Introduction:**

This document explains how to analyze and visualize trends in developer activity outside of regular working hours using the **Contributors Working on Non-Working Days** metric. It's represented as a line chart showing the average number of contributors who commit code on non-working days within a chosen timeframe (daily, weekly, or monthly). This metric provides insights into team health, well-being, workload management, and potential workload distribution issues.

### **2. Definitions:**

* **Contributor:** An individual who contributes code to the project repository.
* **Non-Working Day:** A day that falls outside of the team's standard working hours (e.g., weekends, holidays).
* **Contributors Working on Non-Working Days:** The average number of contributors who commit code to the repository on non-working days within a specific timeframe (e.g., day, week, month).

**Workload Management and Distribution:**

* **Increasing Trend:** An upward trend may suggest increasing workload, tighter deadlines, or potential workload imbalances within the team, leading some to work on non-working days.
* **Sudden Spikes:** Short-term spikes in activity could be due to urgent fixes, but frequent occurrences might indicate recurring issues with workload distribution or project planning.

### **5. Key Points:**

* Consider using this metric in conjunction with other metrics (e.g., code churn, issue resolution time) for a more comprehensive view of team well-being, workload management, and project health.
* Remember, some level of non-working day activity might be expected, especially for passionate developers. Context is crucial for interpreting this metric effectively.
