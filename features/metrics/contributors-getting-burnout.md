## Contributors at Risk of Burnout

### **1. Introduction:**

This document explains how to analyze and visualize potential team member burnout using the **Contributors at Risk of Burnout** metric. It's represented as a line chart showing the average number of contributors who exhibit high code commit activity over a chosen timeframe (daily, weekly, or monthly). A contributor is flagged as potentially at risk if their activity suggests they are working for an extended period exceeding a predefined threshold.

**In this case, the threshold is defined as committing code for 90% of a two-week window (approximately 12.6 days out of 14).** This metric provides valuable insights into team health, well-being, and potential workload distribution issues.

### **2. Definitions:**

* **Contributor:** An individual who contributes code to the project repository.
* **Contributor at Risk of Burnout:** A contributor who exhibits code commit activity exceeding a predefined threshold, suggesting they might be working excessive hours.
* **Predefined Threshold:** The set limit for code commit activity that flags a contributor for potential burnout (e.g., 90% of a two-week window).

### **3. Explanation of Charts:**

**Detailed Chart**

The line chart displays the average number of Contributors at Risk of Burnout over a chosen timeframe.

* **Horizontal Axis:** Represents time intervals (e.g., days, weeks, months).
* **Vertical Axis:** Represents the average number of contributors flagged for potential burnout.
* **Trend Line:** Shows the average rate of contributors exceeding the predefined threshold over time.

### **4. Interpretation:**

**Team Health and Well-being:**

* **Low Numbers:** A consistently low number of contributors flagged for burnout suggests a healthy work-life balance within the team.
* **Increasing Trend:** An upward trend may indicate potential burnout risk for a growing number of team members, urging investigation into workload, deadlines, and potential stress factors.

**Workload Management and Distribution:**

* **High Numbers:** A sustained high level of contributors at risk might suggest workload pressure, tight deadlines, or workload imbalances within the team, leading some to overwork.
* **Sudden Spikes:** Short-term spikes in flagged contributors could be due to urgent fixes or project phases with intense activity. However, frequent occurrences warrant closer examination of workload distribution and project planning.

### **5. Key Points:**

* **Proactive Well-being Measures:** Track Contributors at Risk of Burnout to proactively identify and address potential burnout before it impacts individual and team performance.
* **Workload Insights:** Monitor this metric to gain insights into workload distribution and identify areas where adjustments might be necessary to prevent overwork.
* **Open Communication:** Use this data as a starting point for open conversations within the team about workload, well-being, and potential solutions.

### **6. Conclusion:**

Monitoring Contributors at Risk of Burnout provides valuable insights into team health, workload management, and potential work-life balance issues. By analyzing trends and taking corrective actions when necessary, you can promote healthy work practices, distribute workload effectively, and ensure sustainable team performance.

**Additional Considerations:**

* The interpretation of trends may depend on factors like project deadlines, team culture, and individual preferences.
* Consider using this metric in conjunction with other metrics (e.g., code churn, issue resolution time, Contributors Working on Non-Working Days) for a more comprehensive view of team well-being, workload management, and project health.
* Remember, context is crucial. While the metric flags potential risks, it's important to have open communication with team members to understand their working styles and preferences.
