# Feedback Responsiveness Index (FRI)

Tracking Feedback Responsiveness Index (FRI) as a percentage distribution of all the PRs that were merged with code changes made within 24 hours of receiving the first review comment serves several valuable purposes in understanding your Pull Request (PR) development process:

### 1. Identifying Bottlenecks:&#x20;

A low FRI (high percentage of delays in responding to feedback) can indicate:

* Developer workload: Developers might be overloaded with other tasks, delaying their ability to address feedback.
* Unclear requirements or expectations: Developers might need further clarification on the feedback, leading to delays in understanding and implementing changes.
* Communication issues: Ineffective communication between reviewers and developers might slow down the feedback loop.

### 2. Gauging Development Agility:&#x20;

A high FRI suggests developers are actively responding to feedback and incorporating it quickly, potentially leading to faster development cycles and improved code quality.

### 3. Monitoring Process Effectiveness:&#x20;

Tracking changes in FRI over time can help you assess the effectiveness of implemented changes or training programs aimed at improving developer responsiveness to feedback.

#### Conclusion

By combining FRI with other metrics and qualitative analysis, you can gain a deeper understanding of your PR development process and implement targeted improvements to promote quick, effective responses to feedback, ultimately leading to higher code quality and faster development cycles.
